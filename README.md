# CS211 Algorithms & Data Structures 2

This repo is dedicated to a module CS211 Algorithms & Data Structures 2 which I took during my Exchange semester 2024 at the Maynooth University in Ireland.

Each week is discussed a certain topic and an individual assignment is given.

The overview of this module can be summarized as followed:
