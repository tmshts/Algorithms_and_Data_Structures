# CS211 Algorithms & Data Structures 2

This repo is dedicated to a module CS211 Algorithms & Data Structures 2 which I took during my Exchange semester 2024 at the Maynooth University in Ireland.

Each week is discussed a certain topic and an individual assignment is given.

The overview of this module can be summarized as followed:
- 03 week - [Recursion](https://github.com/tmshts/dsa/tree/main/03_week)
- 04 week - [Merge Sort](https://github.com/tmshts/dsa/tree/main/04_week)
- 05 week - [Linked Lists](https://github.com/tmshts/dsa/tree/main/05_week)
- 06 week - [Fundamentals and implementation of Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/tmshts/dsa/tree/main/06_week)
- Balancing Binary Search Trees;
- Tree traversals (depth and breadth-first);
- Graph representations;
- Hash Tables;
- Algorithm analysis: upper and average complexity bounds, best, average and worst case algorithm behaviour;
- Algorithm strategies: brute force, greedy, divide and conquer and backtracking algorithms;
- Selected advanced topics in Algorithms and Data Structures.
